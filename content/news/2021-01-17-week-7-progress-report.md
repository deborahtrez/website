_This is the seventh weekly progress report of my Outreachy internship with Mixxx DJ._

This week:

- I created a YouTube channel for Mixxx tutorials and posted the first video. Its an installation tutorial for Windows OS. Here is the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0tTUb-JpzY) to the YouTube video. This was early in the week.
- Sadly, I did not get a lot done in this week, because our government (Uganda) decided to shut down the internet. We had no access to the web or any internet-based services for at least four days.
  The internet just got restored today (as I write, it's Monday of week 8) but social media is still blocked.
- Since I did not finish accomplishing some of [last week's tasks]({filename}/news/2021-01-04-week-5-progress-report.md), I will work on those first then record the second YouTube tutorial. It will most likely be an in-depth video about mixing once the program is set up (following the first video).
- I will be working on issue [#335](https://github.com/mixxxdj/manual/issues/335) as well. Finding a reasonable arrangement for the Record/ Broadcast your mix chapter.
