_This is the thirteeth weekly progress report of my Outreachy internship with Mixxx DJ._

This week:

- Following last week‚Äôs progress, I finished making the edits to the video, and now, I‚Äôm only waiting to get feedback before I add in any animations or effects. I hope to upload it this week (since I‚Äôm writing this blog in the next week). ü§ûüèΩ
- I have been working on [issue #117](https://github.com/mixxxdj/manual/issues/117) ‚Äì updating the screenshots of the [2.3 manual](https://manual.mixxx.org/2.3/en/index.html) from the Deere to Latenight skin. I hope to make a PR this week.

And‚Ä¶ this is the last week of the Outreachy internship program. This week‚Äôs blog is not as long as the previous ones because I have not documented what I will be doing next week. This is because I have not planned out all of the details yet, but of course, I will be making improvements to the manual ‚Äì next week I will be updating the screenshots in the 2.3 manual from the Deere to the Latenight skin. I hope to check this item off the checklist in this [issue](https://github.com/mixxxdj/manual/issues/117). And then, of course, I will continue making tutorials for the [Mixxx Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1t9_tylS7XPBIJIpXhXQmQ) and working on the cookbook/ DJing techniques chapter.

This has been a great experience interacting and getting to know the Mixxx community virtually.
Overall, I would say my internship has been a success because I was able to gain practical skills, work in a fantastic environment that is really inclusive, and make connections that will last a lifetime.
I could not be more thankful.

This is NOT goodbye, because I am still going to continue contributing to Mixxx, and endeavor to finish the projects that I started.
That is, I will still be making tutorials for the [Mixxx YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1t9_tylS7XPBIJIpXhXQmQ), working on the DJing techniques/cookbook project, and making other improvements to the manual.
See you next week üòâ
