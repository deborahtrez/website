_This is the sixth weekly progress report of my Outreachy internship with Mixxx DJ._

This week:

- I created a YouTube channel for Mixxx tutorials and posted the first video. Its an installation tutorial for Windows OS. Here is the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0tTUb-JpzY) to the YouTube video. This was early in the week.
- Sadly, I did not get a lot done in this week, because our government (Uganda) decided to shut down the internet. We had no access to the web or any internet-based services for at least four days.
  The internet just got restored today (its Monday of the next week, as I write) but social media is still blocked (but this can be bypassed with VPN).
- Since I did not finish accomplishing last week's tasks, I will work on those first and try to finish them, then record the second YouTube tutorial. It will most likely be an in-depth video about mixing once the program is set up (following the first video).
