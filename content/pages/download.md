          We provide a [PPA on Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/~mixxx/+archive/mixxxbetas) to make installing install the latest beta version of Mixxx as easy as possible.
          Open a terminal, and enter:

              $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mixxx/mixxxbetas
              $ sudo apt update
              $ sudo apt install mixxx

          Using the PPA ensures that new package versions will be installed automatically with `apt`. Otherwise, you can [download individual packages](https://launchpad.net/~mixxx/+archive/ubuntu/mixxxbetas/+packages) and install them manually.
        note: |
          **Note:** Ubuntu also provides a version of Mixxx which can be installed directly from the Ubuntu Software Centre. This version is usually woefully out of date; therefore using the PPA is advised.

          An [RPM package](https://admin.rpmfusion.org/pkgdb/package/free/mixxx/) for installation is available in the [RPM Fusion](https://rpmfusion.org/) repositories.

          Please refer to [RPM Fusion's instructions](https://rpmfusion.org/Configuration) on how to enable the repositories on your system. Mixxx only requires enabling the free repository; the nonfree repository is not necessary for Mixxx.

          RPM Fusion builds are maintained by the Mixxx development team. We support the next, the current, and selected previous Fedora release(s) if possible.

          The beta package will be continuously updated until Mixxx 2.3.0 is released.

          The beta version of Mixxx can be [installed](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mixxx_beta-git/#comment-783242) from the Arch User Repository (AUR).
          Open a terminal, and enter:

              $ git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/mixxx_beta-git.git
              $ cd mixxx_beta-git
              $ makepkg -si

          Alternatively, you can also use an [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helpers) to make the installation more straightforward.
        note: |
          **The AUR is an untrusted source.** Although the `mixxx_beta-git` package is maintained by the Mixxx development team, you should always read the `PKGBUILD` of each AUR package you install to make sure it doesn't contain malicious code.

      A great way to contribute to Mixxx is testing the latest code we're working on and giving early feedback. Refer to the [Testing wiki page](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/Testing) for where to find the latest builds and instructions how to test pull requests before they are merged.

      **Development snapshots are not intended for live use!** Expect crashes and make sure to back up your Mixxx settings and library before upgrading as explained in the Testing wiki page.
